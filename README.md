# uMPS_highest-weight-vectors

Uniform matrix product states (uMPS) are translation invariant tensor network varieties associated to cyclic graphs. The variety of uniform matrix product states is naturally invariant under the action of  the special linear group. As a consequence, the ideal of the variety, in every degree, can be seen as a representation of the group. The code is implemented for uMPS with bond dimension two. It computes the highest weight vectors of a chosen degree part of the ideal, providing in particular equations for the variety. The code in this repository is implemented in Macaulay2 and it is part of a joint work with Tim Seynnaeve and Harshit J. Motwani. The details are presented in the paper ''The linear span of uniform matrix product states'' and in the manuscript of my PhD thesis.
